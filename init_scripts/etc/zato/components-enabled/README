Each Zato component - servers, web-admin instances or load-balancers - that needs to be covered by startup scripts,
and run when the operating system is starting, should be symlinked to in this directory.

For instance, to start on boot servers from ..

/opt/zato/prod/server1
/opt/zato/prod/server2

.. the following symlinks should be created:

$ ln -s /opt/zato/prod/server1 /etc/zato/components-enabled/prod.server1
$ ln -s /opt/zato/prod/server2 /etc/zato/components-enabled/prod.server2
